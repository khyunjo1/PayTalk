# PayTalk
This project is a Korean side-dish delivery web app where users log in with Kakao, browse stores, add menus to cart, and place delivery or pickup orders with simulated KakaoPay. Store owners manage orders via their page, while a super admin dashboard lets the operator create stores, manage menus, and handle owner inquiries.
